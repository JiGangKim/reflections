When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're collaborating with other people or you work across different machines (work, home).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want to pull changes when working on a new branch from where you left off at your local Git.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches exist within a repository, clones are two identical repositories, forks are clones managed within GitHub server.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Keeps track of the ancestor of the local master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Google Drive or the like. Easier to manage in terms of just making cloud backups or for solo projects. However would be harder to work with multiple contributers.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you are trying something experimental branching out has the advantage of keeping things compartmentalized. However, working directly on master reduces confusion and is better to manage.
