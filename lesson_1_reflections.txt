How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
No need for manual comparison. Saves time and effort.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can always roll back if there's a problem.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: more flexibility, every commit represents a logical step
cons: user errors are introduced - too much or too little commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Files in the same repository are related, requiring multiple files to be tracked.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log command shows the entire history of the repository. git diff command compares two different versions of the repository.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always revert back to bug-free version by using git checkout command.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For projects using ROS on linux systems.
